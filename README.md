##About:
Smooth Weather allows you to track the current and future weather of cities of your choosing.

##How it works:
-Search for your city by entering the name into the search bar.
-Select a city within the results, this will take you to the current weather for your selection.
-Track the city by clicking on the "+" icon in the top right. This will save the city to view at a later time on the home page.
